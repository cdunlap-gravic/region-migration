# **Minecraft WorldEdit Transfer Assistant**

A command-line tool designed to simplify the complex process of moving large or multi-part structures between different Minecraft1 worlds using WorldEdit and Multiverse-Core commands. It intelligently breaks down large selections into smaller, manageable sub-regions, generating a sequential list of commands for smooth transfer.

## **‚ú® Features**

* **Automated Command Generation:** Generates //copy, //paste, /mvtp (Multiverse-Core teleport), and /tp commands.  
* **Sub-Region Splitting:** Breaks down large source bounding boxes into smaller, user-defined sub-regions to prevent server lag or crashes during large operations.  
* **Multiple Source Regions:** Supports defining multiple distinct source bounding boxes to be moved.  
* **Interactive CLI:** User-friendly command-line interface guides you through input collection.  
* **Input Review & Correction:** Allows you to review all entered parameters before generation and easily go back to modify any field.  
* **Smart Defaults:** Remembers your previous input for re-prompts and provides intelligent defaults (e.g., Creative Mode).  
* **Robust Input Validation:** Ensures valid responses for prompts (e.g., y/n for confirmations, correct coordinate formats).  
* **Negative Coordinate Support:** Fully supports structures located anywhere in the Minecraft world, including negative X and Z coordinates.  
* **Optional Creative Mode:** Includes /gamemode creative commands if you need to ensure you're in creative mode before operations.

## **üöÄ Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

* **Python 3.x:** Installed on your system.  
* **Minecraft Server:** Running a Spigot/Paper/Fabric server (or similar) with the following plugins:  
  * **WorldEdit:** For selection, copying, and pasting.  
  * **Multiverse-Core:** For teleporting between worlds (/mvtp).  
* **Operator Permissions:** You must have sufficient operator (op) permissions or be in a group with access to all WorldEdit and Multiverse commands.

### **Installation**

1. **Download:** Simply download the main.py file from this repository.  
2. **Place:** Save the file to a convenient location on your computer.

### **Usage**

1. **Open your Terminal/Command Prompt:** Navigate to the directory where you saved main.py.  
2. **Run the script:**  
   Bash  
   python main.py

3. **Follow the Prompts:**  
   * The script will ask for your **Source World Name**, **Target World Name**, **Creative Mode** preference, **Source Bounding Boxes**, **Target Paste Origin**, and **Sub-Region Size**.  
   * **Default Values:** For prompts showing \[DefaultValue\], you can just hit Enter to accept the default or type a new value.  
   * **Bounding Boxes:** Enter each bounding box (X1,Y1,Z1,X2,Y2,Z2) on a new line. Type DONE when you've entered all boxes. If re-prompting, you can type KEEP to retain the previously entered list.  
   * **Coordinates:** Enter coordinates as comma-separated values (e.g., 100,64,-200).  
4. **Review Inputs:** After entering all information, the script will display a summary for your review.  
5. **Confirm or Correct:**  
   * Type y or yes and press Enter to confirm and generate the commands.  
   * Type n or no and press Enter to go back and correct any of the inputs.  
   * If you type an invalid response or just hit Enter on the confirmation, it will re-prompt you.  
6. **Execute Commands:**  
   * Once generated, the script will print a long list of WorldEdit and Multiverse commands to your console.  
   * **Crucially:** Copy these commands in the exact order they are generated.  
   * Paste and execute them **one block at a time** (e.g., copy the commands for "SUB-REGION 1", paste into Minecraft chat, wait for it to complete, then move to "SUB-REGION 2", etc.). This sequential execution is vital for large structures to prevent server overload.

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes**

* **BACKUP YOUR WORLDS\!** Before performing any large WorldEdit operations, always create a full backup of both your source and target Minecraft worlds.  
* **Server Performance:** Copying and pasting large regions, even in chunks, can be resource-intensive and may cause temporary server lag or freezes. It's recommended to perform these operations during off-peak hours or on a dedicated test server.  
* **Player Permissions & Position:** The generated commands rely on you having operator permissions. The /tp commands are essential as WorldEdit's //copy and //paste operations are relative to your current player position.  
* **WorldEdit & Multiverse:** Ensure both plugins are installed and functioning correctly on your Minecraft server.
